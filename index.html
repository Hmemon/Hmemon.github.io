								<p>Hi!! My Names Harris Memon (s3763582). s3763582@student.rmit.edu.au.<a href="#work"></a>.</p>
								<p>I was born in Karachi, Pakistan however, I was brought up right here in Melbourne. Like most people in the world I enjoy listening to music, To pass time I sometimes attempt to make my own music, Keyword "Attempt". I'm an indoor kind of person I like sitting on the couch with a packet of chips and taking an hour to figure out what to watch on Netflix.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Intrest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ws.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I’ve always had some kind of involvement or interest in IT since I was a kid, I grew up playing video games and spent most my time behind a screen. When I was young one of my cousins who was a programmer at the time introduced me to programming and I was intrigued as I saw him manipulate the computer and for someone that spent a lot of time in front of one, it was cool to see what’s actually going on behind it, he taught me the key concepts of all programming such as if statements and what variables are and all the basics. I have competed a diploma in general Information technology studies in which I learnt to program in Python and Java. I enjoy figuring out how to make the computer do what I want and solving problems in my code. I also have an interest in artificial intelligence as I’ve always done things on computers set up by others such as played games or applications made by people and I find it fascinating when a computer can make its own decisions and figure things out using data and be able to learn how to understand it.</p>
								<p>I chose RMIT because it’s a leading university in the IT industry and it welcomes creativity and encourages creative thinking. It’s also a very practical university to get to and the location in the middle of the city gives me a lot to do when I’m not doing work. During these studies I would like to polish my knowledge of programming and understand other aspects of IT such as security and AI. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/stockm.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My ideal job is somewhere along the lines of a portfolio manager or an asset manager with an IT twist, using databases, algorithms and AI to manage portfolios and get my clients the best return on their investment. I have an interest in money management and investing and want to bring a more modern approach into the market of managing money. I would like to create my own unique business that can do what no other business can or at least, do it better than the rest (Ambitious I know right). </p>
								<p>As of right now, I have a simple understanding of the stock market and money managing techniques I also understand the basic structure of running a business and using the business as an asset for myself. I have some knowledge and skills in programming and understand the basics but will need to work on these skills to get to where I can create my own management algorithm. To make my business different, ideally, I would like to create artificial intelligence to help me run my own business and maybe even other aspects of my life like an assistant. To obtain the skills I will need I will read books on programming and keep studying the markets to understand the ins and outs. I will talk to industry professionals that may be able to help me in my journey, speaking to people that have started their own businesses within the IT industry as well as the industry of money management.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Idea</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pid.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My project idea is to create an app for people to use to manage their savings and spending’s in a way that it would make it more attractive and fun for people to save and invest money. The application will be able to show and track the spending of users linked to their bank accounts to show them exactly where their money is coming from and going. The app will have a database of products at stores and tracks when a user buys something, for example, cooking oil, the app will show that they can find this brand of cooking oil at this store for even cheaper. The app will show long term figures for example if they are saving $2 every time they purchase the suggested product from the app and they take the apps recommendation every week for 2 products, the app will show that they are saving $208 at the end of the year rather than $4 when buying the products. This will attract the user with as most people would like to see that amount of money be saved. Where this app is different is that it allows people to still spend money where they want to, most financial advice apps or even advisors will tell people to spend less on unnecessary things such as going out so they can afford the necessities, however this app will reverse that idea and show people how to spend less and save on their necessities so they have more money left over at the end of the day. The app will also have a robot-investing feature where users can opt to have a portion of their savings invested into the market in safe and secure way using index funds and ETFs picked by AI to slowly grow their money and earn interest rather than having inflation decrease the value of their savings every year.</p>
								<p>Australians have a big problem with saving money. Over 25% of Australians cannot afford a $1000 emergency without going into debt and over 50% of young Australians have less than $5000 saved and a small 5% have over $50,000 saved. 19% of Australians seek financial help and 15% of people have had to sell or pawn something to pay for necessities. 42% of households have the same amount of income as last year. This app will show people a way to have more money saved at the end of the year without having to make more. 31% of Australians hold shares in at least one company, this shows that Australians are open to investing however, most may be unaware of where to start and not be bold enough to take the first step to dive into the markets. This app will take that step for them and show them figures from past performance of the index funds where their money will go to give them an idea of where their money is going to go and what return they can expect in the long term.</p>
								<p>The most important tools and technologies needed for this app are the databases that can collect data from stores to show the prices of products in the users area. To make this app the best that it can be, some money professionals such as accountants and investment managers may need to be hired to study the markets and to make decisions on what’s best for the users personal situation as many users will be at a different stage of life and will be at different places economically. </p>
								<p>For this app I will need to have a solid understanding of money management, investing and programming. There is no shortage of accountants that can teach money management skills that can be translated to the app and from the app through to the users to educate them. I will have to be at a very advanced level of programming to insure this app is working and safe as it will be taking many users important details and I will have to know about IT security to keep the users details safe. I will have to learn about the maths behind the stock market to ensure that the AI makes the right decisions and can predict the market in the most accurate way.</p>
								<p>My goal for this app, if successful is to increase the amount of money Australians have in their saving. This app will better the financial health of Australians and in affect increase the Australian economy as more Australians will have savings. This app will also increase the number of Australians that are exposed to the stock market and put more money into Australia’s economy while making the user more money. It will also educate many Australians in money management and help them understand and make the right decisions to help them live a more comfortable life. The original problem of Australians not having enough savings will not be solved however, the percentage of Australians with no savings will drop allowing those people to live more comfortably. This app will encourage more Australians to save money and make them think more consciously about where they are spending their money and where their money is being wasted.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/brn.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My results for the online Myers Briggs test showed that I was of a mediator personality type. Mediator Personalities are guided by their principles rather than logic, mediators are led by the purity in their intent and not rewards or punishment. Mediators qualities allow them to communicate deeply with others and share their ideas in unique and creative ways. Mediators can be useful in team-based workplaces where communication is key. They can easily get their ideas across to others and make It easy to understand while also wanting to listen to other ideas.</p>
								<p>An online learning styles test results showed that I was a combination of the 3 learning styles but leaning towards being a Visual learner. Visual learners learn by seeing pictures or reading books and understand and remember things by sight and can picture things that they are learning in their head. Visual learners are neat and clean. They can sometimes find it hard to understand spoken directions but are attracted to colour and spoken instructions that are rich in imagination.</p>
